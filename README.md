#House Price Prediction

This project aims to predict house prices using various machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Lasso. The dataset has been preprocessed by normalizing the data, removing outliers, and dropping unnecessary columns. I experimented with the models both before and after normalizing the data, and the results showed improved performance after normalization.

#Key steps:

Data Cleaning: Removed outliers and dropped irrelevant columns.
Feature Engineering: Normalized the dataset to improve model performance.
Modeling: Applied Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Lasso models for prediction.
Evaluation: Compared the model performances before and after normalization.
This project demonstrates how preprocessing steps like normalization can significantly impact the accuracy of machine learning models.
